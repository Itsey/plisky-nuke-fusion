Plisky.Nuke.Fusion Readme.  V0.

This is the package for Plisky.Nuke.Fusion.  This package provides Nuke build support for the Plisky tools.  It adds Nuke tasks to support:
* mollycoddle
* versonify
* glitter


Ultimately I hope that this package can be replaced with inclusion into the Nuke build package but this is a temporary home while I get to grips with the tooling and the approach for providing contributions.

See [http://itsey.github.io](http://itsey.github.io) for more information on the Plisky tools.
